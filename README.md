# landing-page

## Assignment
Create an entire webpage from a design provided for you. Files given are in /images.

## Approach
Using the image provided + fonts/colour cheatsheet, I uapplied the knowledge learned to date to produce this landing page. In the `<head>` section of my index.html file, I used properties from the Open Graph Protocol, after learning about them while creating my [VV Presence](https://github.com/lesliemathys/vv-presence) project. I leaned heavily on Flex Box to recreate the layout as closely as possible. 

I feel as though I am using too many flex containers, and that there may be more succinct ways to achieve the same look, but I'm certain I can get there in time. 

This was the first project in which I used `:root`
